## What is a "connection"?

A connection (`ConnectionEntity`) represents a database registered in the system. It is the unit on which **backup**, **restore** and **cronjobs** operate.

It's not the database itself — it's **the pointer with credentials** to access it.

---

## Required fields at registration time

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `name` | string (max 100) | yes | Human-readable identifier |
| `environment` | `prod` \| `dev` \| `sqa` | yes | Drives the applicable security rules |
| `dbType` | `postgres` \| `mysql` | no (default `postgres`) | Determines the engine and tooling used |
| `host` | string | yes | Hostname or IP |
| `port` | 1–65535 | yes | Engine port |
| `database` | string | yes | Database name inside the engine |
| `username` | string | yes | User with role-appropriate permissions |
| `password` | string | yes | Stored as plaintext, excluded from responses via `@Exclude()` |

### Minimum user permissions per engine

- **PostgreSQL**: user with `CONNECT` privilege; `pg_dump` requires `SELECT` on every table to back up.
- **MySQL**: user with `SELECT`, `LOCK TABLES`, `SHOW VIEW`, `EVENT`, `TRIGGER`.

> **Heads up — SSL/TLS**: the codebase does not handle SSL/TLS explicitly today. Connections are direct TCP. If your managed DB requires SSL (Neon, RDS with SSL enforced, etc.), append the appropriate driver-level params to the connection string (e.g. `?sslmode=require` for Postgres). See [connecting-cloud-databases.md](connecting-cloud-databases.md) and [architecture-roadmap.md](architecture-roadmap.md).

## Endpoints

```
GET    /connections             List every active connection
GET    /connections/:id         Get a specific connection
POST   /connections             Create a connection (any environment)
PATCH  /connections/:id         Update a connection (BLOCKED if PROD)
DELETE /connections/:id         Delete a connection (BLOCKED if PROD)
POST   /connections/test        Test a connection by ID in the body
POST   /connections/:id/test    Test a connection by ID in the URL
POST   /connections/test-raw    Test credentials without saving a connection
```

```
GET    /backups/history                History of jobs enriched with the connection name
POST   /backups                        Creates a backup (connectionId in the body)
POST   /backups/trigger/:connectionId  Manual trigger by connectionId (no body)
PUT    /backups/settings/:connectionId Configures or updates that connection's cronjob
GET    /backups/r2                     Lists raw objects in R2
GET    /backups/:id                    Gets a backup job by ID
```

Every endpoint requires a valid session (Better Auth).

## PROD rules (security invariants)

A connection with `environment === 'prod'` is **immutable** from the API:

| Action | PROD | DEV / SQA |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Create (`POST`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read (`GET`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Test connection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit (`PATCH`) | ❌ `403 Forbidden` | ✅ |
| Delete (`DELETE`) | ❌ `403 Forbidden` | ✅ |
| Back up from it | ✅ | ❌ `400 BadRequest` |
| Restore into it | ❌ `403 Forbidden` | ✅ |

**Why:** PROD is the source of truth. Modifications to a PROD connection happen via **infrastructure/DBA** directly, not via the application. This prevents a user with API permissions from pointing the backup job at a rogue host.

### What if I legitimately need to disable a PROD connection?

There is no endpoint. By design. The legitimate options are:

1. **Recreate the setup**: register the new correct PROD connection and leave the old one in place — backups point at the new `connectionId`.
2. **Direct DB maintenance**: `UPDATE connections SET is_active = false WHERE id = '...'` executed by a DBA with physical access to the control DB. This path lives outside the app's audit log — that's intentional, it's infrastructure maintenance.

---

## Connection testing

There are two modes:

### By ID (already saved connection)

```http
POST /connections/:id/test
POST /connections/test    { "connectionId": "..." }
```

### Raw (without saving — useful while filling the form)

```http
POST /connections/test-raw
{
  "host": "...", "port": 5432, "database": "...",
  "username": "...", "password": "...", "dbType": "postgres"
}
```

Both return:

```json
{ "success": true, "latencyMs": 47 }
```

```json
{ "success": false, "latencyMs": 5023, "error": "password authentication failed for user 'foo'" }
```

The test uses the engine's native client (`pg.Client` for Postgres, `mysql2/promise` for MySQL), not the CLI tools. Fixed timeout of **5 seconds**.

## Backup history

`GET /backups/history` returns jobs enriched with the connection name:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "connectionId": "...",
    "connectionName": "prod-postgres",
    "environment": "prod",
    "status": "completed",
    "fileKey": "backups/.../2026-05-07T02-00-00.dump",
    "fileSizeMb": 142.7,
    "startedAt": "2026-05-07T02:00:00.000Z",
    "completedAt": "2026-05-07T02:01:23.000Z",
    "errorMessage": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-05-07T02:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

If the connection was deleted (soft delete), `connectionName` returns `"(deleted)"`.

## Operational notes

- **Soft delete**: when `DELETE` is applied to a non-PROD connection, it is not physically removed — it's marked `isActive: false`. Historical backups/restores referencing it remain queryable.
- **Listing**: `GET /connections` only returns `isActive: true`. There is no endpoint to list soft-deleted ones.
- **Audit**: every `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` is recorded in `audit_logs` with `userId`, `userEmail`, `action`, `metadata` (the full body) and `environment`.
- **Streams**: the dump is uploaded to R2 via multipart upload (`@aws-sdk/lib-storage`) directly from the process's stdout — no disk writes.
