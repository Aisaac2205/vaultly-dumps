/**
 * Brings audit_logs up to the attributes OWASP requires per security event
 * (source address, outcome, severity) so Better Auth events can be recorded
 * in the same append-only trail as resource mutations.
 *
 * `environment` becomes nullable because its enum describes the environment
 * of an audited ERP connection (prod/dev/qa). A sign-in has no such
 * environment, and stamping one would poison the audit list filter.
 *
 * ALTER TABLE does not fire the audit_logs_immutable trigger — it is
 * declared BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE FOR EACH ROW — so the append-only
 * guarantee is untouched by this migration.
